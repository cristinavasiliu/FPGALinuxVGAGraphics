Files that are generated in a Quartus project


The five levels:

1. Project level      - Creates a new project and defines settings, including target device, design files, and project-specific configurations. 
                      - You can specify input files, such as RTL code, constraints, and IP core files. 
2. Compilation level  - Converts RTL code to a form that can be programmed onto the target device. 
                      - The compilation process involves several stages such as analysis, synthesis, placement, and routing. 
		      - During compilation, Quartus analyzes the design hierarchy, performs synthesis, places and routes the design elements on the target device, and generates the final programming file (bitstream file). 
3. Synthesis level    - Quartus takes the RTL code and transforms it into a gate-level netlist. 
4. Optimization level - Focuses on further optimizing the design to meet specific criteria/performance goals, such as improving timing constraints, reducing power consumption, etc. 
5. Analysis level     - Generates reports to evaluate the design's characteristics and performance.
                       				   

1. Project Level 
- '.qpf' (Quartus Project File) References .qsf, stores information about the project, including project settings, design files, and other project-specific configurations.
   To generate: FILE -> NEW PROJECT WIZARD
- '.qsf' (Quartus Settings File) Lists design files, entity settings, target device, synthesis directives, and placement constraints that are used during the compilation process.
   To generate/ edit: ASSIGNMENTS -> SETTINGS
- '.sdc' (Synopsys Design Constraints) Contains timing constraints for the design, clock properties, exceptions and setup/hold.
   To generate/ edit: TOOLS -> TIMING ANALYZER
- '.qws' (Quartus Workspace) Is an intermediate file. It stores the project settings, open files, and other related information. It is automatically generated when you save your project.

2.0. System integration level (occurs before or alongside the compilation level)
- '.qsys' (Platform Designer System) By using the platform designer to create and configure your system design and then saving it, the .qsys file will be automatically generated.
   To edit: TOOLS -> PLATFORM DESIGNER 
 
2.1. Compilation Level 
- '.qsf' (Quartus Settings File) Is generated at the compilation level and contains the project-specific settings and constraints that are used during the compilation process. 
- '.sopcinfo' (System-Level IP Information) If you use (System-On-a-Programmable-Chip) or Platform Designer, this file contains information about the instantiated IP cores and their configurations.
- '.vqm' (Verilog Quartus Macro) Contains Quartus-specific macro definitions, allowing you to define and use macros in your Verilog design. (Contains scripts for third-party EDA tools)
   To edit: ASSIGNMENTS -> SETTINGS -> EDA TOOL SETTINGS

3. Synthesis Level
- '.syr' (Synthesis  Report) Provides information about the systems process, including resource utilization, warnings, and errors encountered during synthesis
   To generate/ edit:
- '.vo' (Verilog Output) and '.vho' (Verilog Header Output) These files contain the synthesized Verilog netlist and Verilog header information, respectively. (Contains scripts for third-party EDA tools)
   To edit: ASSIGNMENTS -> SETTINGS -> EDA TOOL SETTINGS
   
4. Optimization Level
- '.sof' (SRAM Object File) Is the final output file that contains the configuration data for programming the FPGA. It is generated after the design has gone through the optimization, placement, and routing steps (successful compilation).
   To edit: TOOLS -> PROGRAMMER 
- '.pof' (Programmable Object File) It is the output file format used to program certain types of programmable logic devices (PLDs)
   To edit: TOOLS -> PROGRAMMER 
   
5. Analysis Level
- '.rpt' (Report Files) Quartus generates various report files at the analysis level, providing detailed information about the design analysis, including design hierarchy, resource utilization, and more.
 
The '.qar' (Quartus Archive) file is generated at different levels and contains an archive of specific files or reports. It is typically generated when you save specific reports or subsets of project files 
using the 'Archive Report' or 'Archive' options in Quartus. To edit: PROJECT -> ARCHIVE PROJECT

Additionally, Quartus generates temporary and intermediate files during the design process, such as '.jdi' (Jam Design File), '.bak' (Backup Files), and more.
These serve as intermediate, backups and temporary files and can be safely ignored. 

!! Avoid manually editing .qpf, .qsf, .ip, and .qsys files.
