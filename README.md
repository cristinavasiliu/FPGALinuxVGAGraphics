# Linux on FPGA (DE1-SoC) + VGA graphics 

The project is divided into two main components: first, setting up Linux on the FPGA (specifically the DE1-SoC board from Intel), and second, implementing bare-metal VGA graphics using the FPGA.

 <h3>Linux images:</h3>

I used two Linux images for this project: <br />
'Linux LXDE Desktopâ€™ from Terasic: https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=836&PartNo=4 <br />
And a Linux console for the DE1-SoC from Intel: https://fpgacademy.org/courses.html <br />

<h3>Developing Linux programs for the DE1-SoC board:</h3> 

There are two methods for developing a Linux program for the DE1-SoC board: native compilation and cross-compilation. Native compilation involves writing and compiling code directly on the DE1-SoC board using the Linux command line or GUI interface. In contrast, cross-compilation allows you to write and compile the program on a host computer (ex: Windows), and then transfer the executable file to the microSD card containing the Linux file system. For more information, refer to pages 14-15:

How to run using native compilation: <br />
Run the following command in the Linux terminal: tclsh run_umbrella.tcl <br />
(Make sure that TCL script, shell script, header file (.h) and the c file are in the same directory) <br />

Or: <br />
Compile c file directly:
gcc <file_name>.c -o <file_name> <br />
Then run: 
./<file_name> <br />

 <h3>VGA Graphics:</h3>

The VGA graphics were generated by accessing the board's I/O peripherals through its address range. A combination of HPS memory components and Cyclone V FPGA components was utilized to render text, shapes, and images on the VGA display. For a detailed explanation, please take a look at the project documentation. Below are demonstrations of each C file.  <br />

1. coloured_dot.c <br />
This file includes the following features: a multi-colored square, rectangle, line, text, a white pixel in the top-left corner, a red comet in the top-left corner, and an RGB pixel.  <br />

2. moving_square_screensaver.c  <br />
A multi-colored moving square screensaver. To improve its performance, it can be optimized for smoother motion.  <br />

3. moving_square_test1.c  <br />
No refresh between the moving square results in a blue line effect, resulting in the screen being gradually colored from left to right.  <br />

4. moving_square_test2.c  <br />
The refresh rate is set too high, causing the square to be visible as it moves. However, it still doesn't move smoothly.  <br />

5. moving_square_smooth.c  <br />
The blue square moves smoothly across the screen.  <br />
